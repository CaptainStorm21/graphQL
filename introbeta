with graphQL we define a query 



a query looks like JSON object without the values



then we send the query as a string to graphql server











query 



{



state {



name



population



people



}



}







response



{  



   "data":{  



      "state":{  



         "name":"Ohio",



         "population":900



         "people": [...]



      }



   }



}











Advantages of GRAPHQL



avoids multiple REST calls



backwards comparable and version-free



can be wrapped around existing API



it is language agnostic
